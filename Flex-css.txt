Flex has two parts Parent and the children:

eg. 
.sample-class{
  display: flex;    // the flex properties are given for the parent element
  display: inline-flex;

}

Flex properties:
flex properties are of two types
1) one that affects the parent or the all children properties 
2) one that affects individual properties

1) One that affects all the children
  - flex-direction: row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse
  - flex-wrap: nowrap(default), wrap, wrap-reverse
  - justify-content (horizontal alignment): 
    - justify-content: flex-start;  // default behaviour
    - justify-content: flex-end; // boxes are swifted towards the right hand side
        Evenly distributed 
    - justify-content: space-between. // all the children are spaced equally inside the parent container
    - justify-content: space-around. // add margin around the child elements
    - justify-content: space-evenly. // the margin is spread evenly
    - justify-content: center. // content are placed at the center
    
  - align-item //for the vertical alignment of the items
